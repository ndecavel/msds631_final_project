# Automobile Make Classification of Videos

## Description

Our application is envisioned to be able to classify car makes from a video by using a variety of technologies. To do so we are implementing two main models: 1) YOLOv5 with frozen backbone layers trained on our video dataset (Berkeley DeepDrive) to detect automobiles, and 2) Car make classification model trained on the Stanford Cars Dataset. Once our models are trained, a traffic video will be inputted into the YOLO model to identify the cars and still images will be fed to the classification model to identify what make each of the automobiles are.
